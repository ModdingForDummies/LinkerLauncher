# LinkerLauncher
A modification and fix for the Black Ops Launcher that was included with LinkerMod patch for the Black Ops Mod Tools.

# WARNING
Do NOT compile. The Launcher has errors that we will fix soon. This is the result of making the code and updating the solution for Visual Studio 2019 compatibility.

# Purpose of the Launcher
This launcher is in a dire need of fixes. From light settings to even reflections. With the proper fixes, the Launcher can do map compiling without needing to place extra settings to annoy you.

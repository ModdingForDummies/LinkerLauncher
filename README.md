# LinkerLauncher
A modification and fix for the Black Ops Launcher that was included with LinkerMod.

# Purpose of the Launcher
This launcher is in a dire need of fixes. From light settings to even reflections. With the proper fixes, the Launcher can do map compiling without needing to place extra settings to annoy you.

- Nukem9 (for creating the project in the first place)
- SE2Dev (for creating the project in the first place, also telling one of our members for what tool we can use to disassemble the launcher)
